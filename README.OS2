DD2 V0.2.1
----------------

SDL Application, compiled to OS/2 with GCC V3.3.5 B4

Requirements:
 - Scitech SNAP
 - DART

If something goes wrong (crash, freeze, etc...), do the following:
- Delete the c:\popuplog.os2 file
- Start dd2.exe this way: dd2.exe >stdout.txt 2>stderr.txt
- After the crash/freeze, pack the stdout.txt stderr.txt and c:\popuplog.os2
  files into one zip and send to me.

Have a nice time playing!
